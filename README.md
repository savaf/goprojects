# Go Projects Collection

This collection is inspired by the original ["Five Go Projects"](https://youtu.be/gXmznGEW9vo) from Dreams of Code. The goal of this collection is to facilitate learning Go through practical projects, while expanding the scope by creating additional projects to achieve specific objectives.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains multiple folders, each representing an independent project. Each folder includes a README file with instructions, descriptions, and supplementary resources to help me develop the project. Additionally, each project includes a section where I reflect on the lessons learned and the new skills acquired.

### Current Projects

### Current Projects

1. **Task CLI (Todo List CLI)**
   - This project involves building a command-line application for managing a to-do list, similar to a task manager. It allows you to add, list, complete, and delete tasks. It’s a great way to learn about data management in Go.
   - **Learning Focus:** Command-line applications, handling user input, and managing data structures.
   
2. **Backend API (Calculator)**
   - Build a backend API for a calculator service using Go. This will include an OpenAPI specification file that defines the endpoints for basic calculation operations.
   - **Learning Focus:** API development, handling HTTP requests, and defining API contracts with OpenAPI.

3. **Web Scraper (Broken Link Detector)**
   - The goal is to create a web scraper that detects dead links on a webpage. This project helps you learn about HTTP handling, HTML parsing, and how to write tests to ensure the scraper works properly.
   - **Learning Focus:** Web scraping techniques, parsing HTML, and error handling.

4. **URL Shortener (Frontend and Backend)**
   - This project involves developing a complete URL shortener web application, with both frontend and backend built in Go. It’s a perfect opportunity to learn full-stack web development using Go.
   - **Learning Focus:** Full-stack development, web frontend and backend integration, and handling user requests.

5. **Currency Converter (CLI)**
   - Build a currency converter for the terminal that uses an external API to retrieve updated exchange rates. A simple form will be implemented to input data via the terminal.
   - **Learning Focus:** Working with external APIs, terminal input forms, and currency conversion logic.



## Project Goals

Each project aims to:
- Encourage hands-on experience with Go development.
- Provide development challenges that cover different areas of the language, such as CLI applications, backend development, web scraping, full-stack development, and API consumption.
- Create an environment where I can improve their skills by solving real-world problems.
- Reflect on the learning process by documenting what I was learned and any new techniques or knowledge gained.
